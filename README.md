# hello-world
First Repository
My name is Chris and I am new to the developer community. I am exploring career change opportunities and would like to have a more mobile, nomadic lifestyle. I work full time for a non-profit and am taking courses in my spare time. Would love to be able to quit my job and travel the world working freelance (3 year goal).
